    "### Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python. It is used to build web applications and APIs without imposing a specific project structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask:\n",
    "- Supports RESTful Request Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful API: Flask's routing system and support for request handling make it suitable for building RESTful APIs.\n",
    "Easy Integration: It integrates well with tools like Flask-RESTful to create comprehensive APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to Deploy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment: Flask applications can be easily deployed to various platforms, including Heroku, AWS, and more, thanks to its compatibility with the WSGI standard.\n",
    "Scalable Hosting: Suitable for cloud hosting, containerization (e.g., Docker), and other modern deployment techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lightweight and Simple to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimal Setup: Flask requires minimal setup, making it quick and easy to start a new project.\n",
    "Simplicity: The framework’s simplicity allows developers to focus on writing code without dealing with unnecessary complexities."

    "### Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs (web addresses) to functions that handle the requests made to those URLs. Essentially, it defines how the web application responds to different HTTP requests (like GET, POST) directed to various endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "- URL Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "They allow you to define and manage the structure of the URLs in your web application. Each route corresponds to a unique URL that triggers a specific function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Language Independency:\n",
    "\n",
    "It proviedes us mechanism to make language independent functions because at the end of the day, we are npt using function directly but instead use the URL binded to them to get POST and GET requests and to make APIs."
